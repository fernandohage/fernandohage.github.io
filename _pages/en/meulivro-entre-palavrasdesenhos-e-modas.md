The book _Between words, drawings and fashions: a journey with João Affonso_ (Appris Editora, 2020) looks at the work and trajectory of João Affonso do Nascimento (1855-1924), author of the book _Three centuries of fashions_, published in 1923, in Belém, and with a significant role in the press and art criticism as a designer and chronicler in the cities of São Luís, Belém and Manaus between the years 1872 and 1917.

In it you will be able to find a walk through the paths of a figure who began his career alongside the prominent brothers Arthur and Aluísio Azevedo, in the circuit of young Maranhão people, who participated in the effervescent cultural movement of the Belle Époque in the Amazon and Paris, and left as a legacy the first fashion history book written by a Brazilian that is known, which was also presented as an art exhibition in Belém, stimulated by the painter Theodoro Braga.

We will stroll through the universe of naturalist literature of Maranhão origin, through the development of caricatures, through the ways of dressing and the daily life of the cities of São Luís and Belém at the end of the eighteen hundreds registered in drawings, through the influence of Paris and the fashion of hats of the Belle Époque, through the formation of a historical view of Belém in its tricentenary, up to the analysis of the construction of a Brazilian fashion history book, under European influence, but with local excerpts.

This book, in addition to presenting more than 30 original illustrations produced by the author for his illustrated magazines, also makes available, for the first time, four original chronicles published in the 1910s, in the daily newspaper Folha do Norte, namely: "The imperishable top hat", "Women in shorts in geography and history", "The commerce of fashions" and "My little suit of casimere".
