## About the Project

This project aims to disseminate old works that were part of the bibliography of the book "Três Séculos de Modas" (Three Centuries of Fashion) (1923), by João Affonso do Nascimento. The author, an acclaimed art critic and caricaturist from northern Brazil, would write in 1914 that his inheritance to his grandchildren would be his library. Therefore, we make available here some of the works that João Affonso cites at the end of his book—most of them unfortunately in foreign languages, but all freely accessible—to eternalize (in some sense) the wish of our beloved writer.

## The Book

This project is part of the launch of my book "Entre palavras, desenhos, costumes e modas: um percurso com João Affonso" (Between words, drawings, customs, and fashions: a journey with João Affonso), published by Appris. In this book, my master's research, subsequent studies, an edition of more than 30 illustrations, and full original texts come together to recall various aspects involving society between the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, the content of this page offers a complementary universe that further enriches the book.

Written to commemorate the tercentenary of Belém, the book takes a tour through men's and women's fashions from 1616 to 1916, and can be considered the first Brazilian book on fashion history. The first edition of the book can be accessed digitally at the Biblioteca Brasiliana Guita e José Mindlin/USP.
