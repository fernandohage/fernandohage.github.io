This project aims to disseminate old works that are part of the bibliography of the book "Três Séculos de Modas" (1923), by João Affonso. The author, an acclaimed art critic and caricaturist from northern Brazil, who in 1923 would write his work on the history of fashion, had already said in 1914 that his library would be his inheritance to his grandchildren. Therefore, we make available here 48 works that João Affonso cites at the end of his book, all with digital access, to immortalize the writer's wish.

## About João Affonso

Writer, illustrator, and art critic, João Affonso do Nascimento (1852-1924) was born in Maranhão and simultaneously built a career in port trade and the press, which led him to live in cities like Belém, Manaus, and Paris. Respected as an art critic, journalist, and chronicler, he created his own illustrated magazines and published the book "Três Séculos de Modas" in 1923, for which he used his vast knowledge of art and literature, as well as the library we present here, to produce the work.

## The Book "Entre Palavras, Desenhos e Modas"

This project is part of the launch of my book "Entre palavras, desenhos, costumes e modas: um percurso com João Affonso," published by Appris. In this book, my master's research, subsequent studies, a selection of more than 30 illustrations, and full original texts come together to recall various aspects involving society between the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, the content of this page provides a complementary universe that adds even more to the book.
