## About the Project

This project aims to disseminate old works that were part of the bibliography for the book "Três Séculos de Modas" (Three Centuries of Fashions) (1923), by João Affonso do Nascimento. The author, an acclaimed art critic and caricaturist from northern Brazil, wrote in 1914 that his inheritance to his grandchildren would be his library. Therefore, we make available here some of the works that João Affonso cites at the end of his book, most of them unfortunately in foreign languages, but all with free access, to eternalize (in some sense) the wish of our dear writer.

## The Book

This project is part of the launch of my book "Entre palavras, desenhos, costumes e modas: um percurso com João Affonso" (Between words, drawings, customs, and fashions: a journey with João Affonso), published by Appris. In this book, my master's research, subsequent studies, an edition of more than 30 illustrations, and complete original texts come together to recall various aspects of society between the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, with the content of this page, we can have a complementary universe that adds even more to the book.

Written in commemoration of the tercentenary of Belém, the book takes a journey through men's and women's fashions from 1616 to 1916, and can be considered the first Brazilian book on fashion history. The first edition of the book can be accessed digitally at the Biblioteca Brasiliana Guita e José Mindlin/USP.

## Importance of Illustrated Magazines

Brazilian illustrated magazines from the late 19th and early 20th centuries are fundamental sources for understanding the visual culture, customs, and especially the fashion of the time. João Affonso, as an art critic and a keen observer of society, used these publications as important references for his work on the history of clothing in Brazil.

These magazines document not only fashion trends imported from Europe but also local adaptations and creations, offering a unique overview of the evolution of Brazilian customs during the tropical Belle Époque period.
