## [Current Topics in Folha de São Paulo](blog-clipping/temas-atuais-na-folha-de-sao-paulo.html)

8/7/2021

Between July and August 2021, I collaborated with 2 articles published in Folha de São Paulo that dealt with very current themes and their relations with fashion: protest t-shirts used in vaccination posts and the clothing style in skate culture, one of the most prominent sports of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

The articles, the first by Wesley Faraó Klimpel, and the second by Carolina Moraes and Daniel E. Castro, were so good that they gained republications in other channels.

## [Lecture "Resistance in the History of Fashion" - UMI Digital](blog-clipping/palestra-resistencia-na-historia-da-moda-umi-digital-unifor.html)

6/15/2021

At the invitation of Unifor (Universidade de Fortaleza), I participated in an online lecture on YouTube for Unifor Moda Integral, UMI DIGITAL, which in this edition had the theme "RE-EXIST".

The subject, "resistance in the history of fashion", was a proposition made to me, who built a lecture with references from the national and international fashion history showing moments in which Fashion proved to be a resistant activity field and always in transformation. My lecture cites important characters in our fashion history such as: Coco Chanel, Elsa Schiaparelli, Zuzu Angel, Martin Margiela, Rei Kawakubo, Vivienne Westwood, as well as movements such as Slow Fashion, Fashion Revolution and new looks for a fashion that resists as that of the artist from Pará LaboYoung.

## [Lecture Creation Processes with the Normando Brand](blog-clipping/palestra-processos-de-criacao-com-a-marca-normando.html)

11/16/2020

At the invitation of the FAAP Fashion Course, the stylist and creative director of the Normando brand, Marco Normando, held a meeting on the Zoom platform with students on November 18th to talk about his professional career since his participation in the Hotspot movement, acting in the style of the Alexandre Herchcovitch brand to the creation of his homonymous brand.

Normando is a brand with origins in the Brazilian Amazon. The stylist Marco Normando seeks inspiration and references in his roots to create high-quality pieces. He develops garments that converse with the contemporary consumer from the choice of raw materials, through intelligent modeling and meticulous finishes, to tailoring built with detail.

In the meeting, mediated by me, the stylist Marco Normando spoke about his creative process, the relations with the Amazonian culture, his market vision, socio-environmental responsibility and the importance of building an image within a Fashion brand.

The lecture was featured in the newspaper Diário do Pará on 11/18/2020:

The artists EME, Bárbara, and the stylist Lucilene from the Jalunalê brand and the technical and pertinent information from the UFPA intellectual property professor, Maria Brasil, are interviewed. The documentary combines poetry and important information for the creative sector and it was a pleasure to participate commenting on the concept of authorial fashion and creative economy in Belém.

10/16/2020

It was with extreme happiness that I received the news that I would be able to launch my book "Entre palavras, desenhos e modas" with highlights within the official launch program of the GT Meetings of Colóquio de Moda - Virtual Edition, after registering in the official notice of the event for launching books.

At the opening of the event, I had 15 minutes to present this project that has only given me happiness and, on top of that, I opened the floor for the official opening lecture, which was given by the historian Denise Santanna, who was my teacher and whom I am a fan of. It was a mixture of emotions to be in this event so important to me and for the construction of this book and on top of that, to launch it online so that anyone could watch it live.

To watch the opening of the event, see the video below which was made available after the live on the Colóquio de Moda channel:

This launch moment was also completed by the media coverage in Pará about the event and the book, media that I got with the support of the press office of [Prioritizes Communication](https://prioriza.ag/). See the articles below:

10/7/2020

Wrapping up my participation in the Estilo Possível podcast season by the beautiful Marina Santa Helena, I participated with some audio comments in a very cool discussion about copying in fashion, how this system works and how we can better understand inspiration and plagiarism within the universe of products.

## [Participation in the Mood Autoral Project](blog-clipping/participacao-no-projeto-moodautoral.html)

9/29/2020

Five Journalism students from PUC-Campinas (Carla Cristine, Gabrielle Castro, Isabeli Lemos, Jaqueline Guerra and Rafaela Barbosa) started a course completion project to talk about authorial fashion and new creators: the Mood Autoral project. Their objective is to democratize access to information about fashion, especially about authorial brands, Slow Fashion and Fast Fashion. The project includes a profile on Instagram, Twitter and a podcast on Spotify, called Mood Talk.

![Logo of the Mood Autoral project](/assets/images/blog-clipping-diario-de-bordo-07.png)

And it was in a conversation on the podcast about "Fashion, Politics and Representation" that I was able to make my contribution to the project, answering questions such as:

What is the importance of brands bringing manifestations, social and racial struggles in their pieces? Can the parade made by Zuzu Angel in 1971 be considered the first political manifestation of fashion in Brazil? What are the precautions that a brand should consider when choosing the theme of its manifestation?

## [Talking about Kitsch and Trashy in the Possible Style](blog-clipping/conversando-sobre-o-kitsch-e-o-cafona-no-estilo-possivel.html)

9/23/2020

Another edition of Marina Santa Helena's Estilo Possível podcast (@santahelena) and in this edition we talked about a controversial, but very interesting topic: kitsch and cafona in Brazilian culture. The chat was great and went through several paths, from the concepts of the term kitsch from the industrial revolution, until we arrived at the elements that make up a kitsch aesthetic and how this appears on the catwalks, in decoration, in the costume. It's worth listening!

Território da Moda is a project that has as its main foundation to strengthen authorial fashion in the clothing sector in the state of Pará. It aims to mature brands thinking about their creative identity and identity with the place.

The project started from the creation of APL de Vestuário, with 3 brands within Espaço Moda at the inauguration. And that's how, from 5 creators in 2017, we added 10 in 2020.

In this year of 2020, a new edition of the event was launched, with the collection of 10 Pará brands: Donna Fran, TuCrias, Patchouli da Amazônia, Lilia Lima, Murilo Maia, Miçante, Ludimila Heringer, Madame Floresta, Prado and Fábio Purificação. The launch featured a live on YouTube of Espaço São José Liberto, with lectures and a fashion show of the brands' looks.

The Amazon Fashion series, a project in which I participated and which I have already commented on in the blog in a previous post, in addition to being shown on FashionTV Brasil, is now also part of the Amazon Prime application catalog, that is, now everyone can watch the series via streaming.

This is a documentary series that presents initiatives that strengthen the segment of the fashion production chain in the Amazon, with its differences to other regions of Brazil. Each episode is dedicated to a type of product, how it fits into the fashion universe, from the origin of the material to the creativity of regional stylists and artisans, who have combined local elements with creative and current looks (app description).
