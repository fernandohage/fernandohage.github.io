## About the Project

This project aims to disseminate old works that were part of the bibliography of the book "Três Séculos de Modas" (1923), by João Affonso do Nascimento. The author, an acclaimed art critic and caricaturist from northern Brazil, would write in 1914 that his legacy to his grandchildren would be his library. Therefore, we make available here some of the works that João Affonso cites at the end of his book, most unfortunately in a foreign language, but all freely accessible, to perpetuate (in some sense) the will of our dear writer.

## The Book

This project is part of the launch of my book "Entre palavras, desenhos, costumes e modas: um percurso com João Affonso", published by the publisher Appris. In this book, my master's research, subsequent studies, an edition of more than 30 illustrations and original texts in full come together to remember several aspects that involve society between the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, with the content of this page we can have a complementary universe that adds even more to the book.

Written in celebration of the tricentenary of Belém, the book takes a tour of men's and women's fashions from 1616 to 1916, and can be considered the first Brazilian fashion history book. The first edition of the book can be accessed digitally at the Biblioteca Brasiliana Guita e José Mindlin/USP.

## Importance of French Magazines

French illustrated magazines from the 19th and early 20th centuries were fundamental in disseminating visual culture and European fashion standards. For João Affonso, these publications represented privileged sources of information about international trends, offering a rich visual repertoire that directly influenced his perception of the evolution of customs and clothing.

These magazines document not only Parisian fashion, but also social, cultural and artistic aspects of the time, constituting an essential visual archive for understanding the French Belle Époque and its global influence.
