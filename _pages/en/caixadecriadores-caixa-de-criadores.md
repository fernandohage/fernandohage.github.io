## About the Project

**Creators' Box** was a cultural project conceived in 2006 in Bel√©m do Par√° by professionals in the fashion industry, which helped build a fashion culture in the capital of Par√°. By 2012, 12 editions of events with fashion shows and retail spaces had been held, showcasing the work of more than 100 brands from the region. This led to the creation of about 15 stores that housed creative enterprises, encouraging the growth of original clothing and accessory production in the metropolitan region of Bel√©m.
