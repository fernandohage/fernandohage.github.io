## About the Project

This project aims to disseminate old works that were part of the bibliography of the book "Três Séculos de Modas" (1923), by João Affonso do Nascimento. The author, an acclaimed art critic and caricaturist from northern Brazil, would write in 1914 that his inheritance to his grandchildren would be his library. Therefore, we make available here some of the works that João Affonso cites at the end of his book, most of them unfortunately in foreign languages, but all freely accessible, to eternalize (in some sense) the wish of our dear writer.

## The Book

This project is part of the launch of my book "Entre palavras, desenhos, costumes e modas: um percurso com João Affonso", published by Appris. In this book, my master's research, subsequent studies, an edition of more than 30 illustrations, and original texts in their entirety come together to recall various aspects involving society between the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, with the content of this page, we can have a complementary universe that adds even more to the book.

Written in celebration of the tercentenary of Belém, the book takes a tour through men's and women's fashions from 1616 to 1916, and can be considered the first Brazilian book on fashion history. The first edition of the book can be digitally accessed at the Biblioteca Brasiliana Guita e José Mindlin/USP.
