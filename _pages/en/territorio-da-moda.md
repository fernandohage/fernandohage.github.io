Project with creative direction by Fernando Hage, spearheaded by the APL de Moda, Design e Indústria do Vestuário do Estado do Pará, based in Espaço São José Liberto.

It consists of an activity of directing and monitoring the work of research, planning, development, production, and launch of a collection of clothing products created by authorial brands that sell their collections in Espaço Moda – São José Liberto.

Its embryo began in 2016 and four collection launches have already been carried out, strengthening the creative image of Paraense authorial fashion, the identity traits of the brands, and the identity of the place as a reference point for Paraense authorial creation in the clothing area, as it is already known in the areas of jewelry, accessories, and handicrafts.

See below the material from the last launch that took place in September 2020 with the participation of 10 Paraense brands.
