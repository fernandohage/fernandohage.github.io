## About the Project

This project aims to disseminate old works that were part of the bibliography of the book "Três Séculos de Modas" (1923), by João Affonso do Nascimento. The author, an acclaimed art critic and caricaturist from northern Brazil, wrote in 1914 that his inheritance to his grandchildren would be his library. Therefore, we make available here some of the works that João Affonso cites at the end of his book, all with free digital access, to immortalize (in a sense) the wishes of our beloved writer.

## Between Words, Drawings, Customs, and Fashions - The Book

This project is part of the launch of my book "Entre palavras, desenhos, costumes e modas: um percurso com João Affonso", published by Appris. In this book, my master's research, subsequent studies, an edition of more than 30 illustrations, and complete original texts come together to recall various aspects involving society between the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, the content of this page provides a complementary universe that adds even more to the book.
