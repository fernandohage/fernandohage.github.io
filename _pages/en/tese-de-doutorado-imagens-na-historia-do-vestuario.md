## Abstract

This thesis seeks to undertake an analysis of the illustrated writing of clothing, highlighting the role of images in this field of study. The research had as a trigger for questioning the book "Três Séculos de Modas", by João Affonso, published in 1923, whose images were analyzed through symptoms present in its set of 56 authorial illustrations.

The text is divided into four sections: the first is dedicated to listing the main theoretical senses that influenced the critical and investigative process, analyzing aspects of clothing and its visuality, historical conceptions of the field of art and clothing, notions of anachronism in images and montage as a method.

Based on these foundations, the second part deals with accessing data on the canons of the history of clothing, discussed by several authors, mapping a set of 35 works located in digital collections referenced for consultation, which were divided into the following categories: clothing books, costume books, engravings and costumes, romantic/historicist books, modern books.

In the third part, the analysis of the pioneering work in Brazil is reached, presenting considerations about its dissemination, locating its characters and the book within the previous historiography, in order to carry out the analysis of its images via the montage process, where symptoms identified in the set of illustrations were examined (by the perception of postures, gestures, objects, silhouettes), which generated the following categories of interpretation: **Blindado; Expressivo; Gracejo; Estar na Moda; Mulher Essencial; Confortável; Conformista; Janota Moderno**.

Such categories demonstrate ways of representing emotions and mentalities about fashion in "Três Séculos de Modas", which can be understood as survivals, which had their aspects discussed in the text and can be used in other research.

Finally, in the last topic, a historical approach was carried out on the illustrated books of the history of clothing published in Brazil, with emphasis on some titles by Brazilian and foreign authors, going towards the so-called visual guides, and concluding the thesis with a chronological listing that seeks to list the set of publications in this field of study in Brazil until 2019.

## Research Contributions

### Developed Analysis Categories

The thesis developed eight categories of interpretation for the analysis of clothing images:

1. **Blindado** - Representations of protection and rigidity
2. **Expressivo** - Gesturality and emotion in images
3. **Gracejo** - Elements of humor and irony
4. **Estar na Moda** - Awareness of trends
5. **Mulher Essencial** - Representations of the feminine
6. **Confortável** - Aspects of practicality in dressing
7. **Conformista** - Adaptation to social norms
8. **Janota Moderno** - Contemporary masculine elegance

### Innovative Methodology

The research used the montage method for image analysis, inspired by the works of Aby Warburg and Georges Didi-Huberman, applying concepts of symptom and visual survival to the field of clothing history.

## Academic Relevance

This thesis represents a significant contribution to fashion studies in Brazil, being the first doctoral research to systematically analyze images in the historiography of Brazilian clothing, establishing methodologies that can be applied in future research in the field.

The research also contributes to the recognition of João Affonso as a pioneer in fashion studies in Brazil, valuing his work and its importance for understanding Brazilian visual culture of the beginning of the 20th century.
