## About the Project

This project aims to disseminate old works that were part of the bibliography of the book "Três Séculos de Modas" (1923), by João Affonso do Nascimento. The author, acclaimed art critic and cartoonist from the north of Brazil, would write in 1914 that his legacy to his grandchildren would be his library. Therefore, we provide here some of the works that João Affonso cites at the end of his book, most unfortunately in a foreign language, but all of free access, to eternalize (in some sense) the will of our beloved writer.

## The Book

This project is part of the launch of my book "Entre palavras, desenhos, costumes e modas: um percurso com João Affonso", published by the Appris publishing house. In this book, my master's research, later studies, an edition of more than 30 illustrations and original texts in full come together to remember various aspects that involve society between the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, with the content of this page we can have a complementary universe that adds even more to the book.

Written in commemoration of the tricentenary of Belém, the book takes a tour of men's and women's fashions from 1616 to 1916, and can be considered the first Brazilian fashion history book. The first edition of the book can be accessed digitally at the Biblioteca Brasiliana Guita e José Mindlin/USP.
