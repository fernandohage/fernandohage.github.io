### Talking about Kitsch and Cafona

**Date:** September 2020  
**Host:** Marina Santa Helena  
**Platform:** ORELO

We talked about a controversial but very interesting topic: kitsch and cafona in Brazilian culture. The conversation went through several paths, from the concepts of the term kitsch from the industrial revolution, until we arrived at the elements that make up a kitsch aesthetic and how this appears on the catwalks, in decoration, in costumes.

## Mood Talk

### Fashion, Politics and Representativeness

**Date:** September 2020  
**Project:** Mood Autoral  
**Platform:** Spotify

Conversation on the podcast about "Fashion, Politics and Representativeness" where I contributed by answering questions such as: What is the importance of brands bringing manifestations, social and racial struggles in their pieces? Can the parade made by Zuzu Angel in 1971 be considered the first political manifestation of fashion in Brazil? What are the precautions that a brand should consider when choosing the theme of its manifestation?

The Mood Autoral project was developed by five Journalism students from PUC-Campinas with the aim of democratizing access to information about fashion, mainly about authorial brands, Slow Fashion and Fast Fashion.
