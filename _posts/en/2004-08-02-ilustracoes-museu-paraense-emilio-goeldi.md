## About the Project

This project consisted of developing illustrations inspired by the architecture and decorative elements of the historic building known as "Rocinha", located within the [Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi](https://www.gov.br/museugoeldi/), in Belém, Pará.

## Description

The illustrations were developed from a detailed study of the architectural and ornamental elements of the historic Rocinha building, located in the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi complex. The main objective was to create a visual repertoire that could be applied to design products, using the screen printing technique for patterning.

### Project Objectives

- **Preservation of visual memory:** Documenting and reinterpreting historical architectural elements
- **Product development:** Creating patterns for application on commercial products
- **Production technique:** Adapting the drawings for the screen printing technique
- **Cultural appreciation:** Promoting the Amazonian visual identity through design

### Creative Process

The project involved extensive visual research and photographic documentation of the decorative elements of Rocinha. From this material, graphical interpretations were developed that maintained the original ornamental essence, adapting them for contemporary application on design products.

## Academic Context

This project was developed as part of a scientific initiation research project advised by **Professor Erlindo Braga**, representing an important experience at the intersection of historical heritage, graphic design, and artisanal production.

### Institutions Involved

- **Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi** - Place of research and inspiration
- **University** - Academic context of the research
- **Screen Printing Laboratory** - Technical development of the patterns
