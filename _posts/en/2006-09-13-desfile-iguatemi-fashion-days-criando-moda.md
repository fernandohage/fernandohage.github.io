## About the Project

The **Criando Moda Iguatemi Fashion Days Fashion Show** marked a historic moment in Fernando Hage's career: the debut of his first original collection on the runway. The **"Anthropic Nature"** collection was a finalist in the prestigious **Criando Moda** contest during Iguatemi Fashion Days in Belém, representing a milestone in contemporary fashion from the state of Pará.

## Collection Concept: "Anthropic Nature"

### Conceptual Philosophy

The **"Anthropic Nature"** collection explored the complex relationship between the **natural** and the **artificial** in contemporary society. The central concept addressed a society that **no longer understands the boundaries between organic nature and human nature**, questioning where the natural ends and the man-made begins.

### Meaning of the Term "Anthropic"

The term "anthropic" refers to human influence on the environment, creating a **nature modified** by human action. The collection materialized this concept through the contrast between organic and industrial elements, symbolizing the urban **concrete jungle**.

## Design Elements

### Utilitarian Inspiration

The looks were developed with **utilitarian inspiration**, prioritizing functionality without sacrificing aesthetics. This approach anticipated trends that would become dominant in fashion years later.

### Materials and Fabrics

- **Denim:** Classic and urban base
- **Poplin:** Structure and formality
- **Twill:** Durability and practicality
- **Sweatshirt fleece:** Comfort and casualness

### Aesthetic Language

- **New Look Elements:** For the womenswear, reviving classic elegance
- **Oriental Influences:** For the menswear, bringing minimalism and sobriety

## Innovative Techniques

### Natural Stamps

One of the collection's major innovations was the use of **stamps made from leaves taken directly from nature**. This artisanal technique created unique and non-reproducible prints, symbolizing the presence of the natural within the artificial.

### Industrial Accessories

The collection incorporated **graffiti-sprayed industrial elements**:

- **Chains:** Symbolizing urban connections
- **Nuts:** Representing the mechanics of the city
- **Sandpaper:** Adding texture to the tactile experience
- **Construction boots:** Functional footwear transformed into fashion

## Color Palette

The color choice reflected the collection's central concept:

- **Green → Gray:** Transition from natural to urban
- **White:** Purity and neutrality
- **Black:** Urbanity and sophistication

This progression symbolized the transformation of organic nature into a **concrete jungle**.
