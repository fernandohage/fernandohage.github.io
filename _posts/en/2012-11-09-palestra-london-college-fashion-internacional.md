A talk as part of the Brazilian Fashion Conference program, hosted at the London College of Fashion in London, organized by Maria Claudia Bonadio, Ana Claudia Suriani da Silva, and Pamela Chuch-Gibson.

On this occasion, I presented the work titled "João Affonso and the urban characters from northern Brazil between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries".

The event's program featured a wide range of discussions involving the contemporary Brazilian fashion market.
