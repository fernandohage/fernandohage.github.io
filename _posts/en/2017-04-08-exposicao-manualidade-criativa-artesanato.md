## Curation and Setup

I curated and set up the **"Creative Handcraft"** exhibition, presented at **Shopping Pátio Belém**, with the goal of promoting the revival of manual work combined with contemporary fashion creation.

## Exhibition Concept

The exhibition explores the intersection between tradition and innovation in fashion, creating a dialogue between established artisanal techniques and materials from the Amazonian popular culture.

### Traditional Techniques

The project showcased traditional fashion knowledge, including:

- **Crochet**: An ancient technique for creating fabric with a hook
- **Fuxico**: A traditional Brazilian handicraft involving the reuse of fabric scraps
- **Hand Painting**: Textile printing and customization techniques

### Innovative Amazonian Materials

The exhibition highlighted the creative use of materials from the Amazonian popular culture:

- **Tururi Fiber**: A material extracted from an Amazonian palm tree
- **Miriti Fiber**: Obtained from the Buriti palm tree, traditional in the region
- **Fish Scales**: Creative reuse of fishing by-products

## Academic Production

The exhibited works were created by students from the **Fashion Design Program at UNAMA** (University of the Amazon) through:

### Group Projects

Collaborative works that explore different techniques and materials, promoting knowledge sharing among students.

### Final Degree Collections

Final projects that represent a synthesis of academic learning, combining theoretical research with practical application.

## Cultural Importance

The "Creative Handcraft" exhibition represents an important movement of:

- **Valuing regional craftsmanship**
- **Preserving traditional techniques**
- **Sustainable innovation in fashion**
- **Training new, conscious designers**
