Fashion Territory is a project whose main foundation is to strengthen original fashion in the apparel sector of the state of Pará. It aims to mature brands by considering their creative identity and their identity with the place.

The project started with the creation of the Apparel APL, with 3 brands inside Espaço Moda at the inauguration. And so, from 5 creators in 2017, we grew to 10 in 2020.

## 2020 Edition

This year, a new edition of the event was launched, featuring the collection of 10 brands from Pará: **Donna Fran**, **TuCrias**, **Patchouli da Amazônia**, **Lilia Lima**, **Murilo Maia**, **Miçante**, **Ludimila Heringer**, **Madame Floresta**, **Prado** and **Fábio Purificação**. The launch featured a livestream on the Espaço São José Liberto YouTube channel, with talks and a fashion show of the brands' looks.

I created a special page about the event on this site, with links to the brands, photos, and press releases, you can access it here: [Fashion Territory](../pages/pt/territorio-da-moda.html)
