*Estilo Possível podcast episode about the history of masks*

Once again I had the pleasure of talking with my friend Marina Santa Helena on the Estilo Possível podcast, this time about the uses and functions of masks within our society, from ancient peoples to the current moment we are living in. It was a very relaxed chat of almost 1 hour that sparked many reflections about the objects and the current moment we are living in.

To listen to the podcast, you must download the ORELO app for free (website [https://www.orelo.audio](https://www.orelo.audio/) - Instagram [@orelo.audio](https://www.instagram.com/orelo.audio/)) and search for Estilo Possível, which is now broadcast exclusively on this platform. Go check it out!
