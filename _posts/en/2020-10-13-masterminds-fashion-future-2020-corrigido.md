During the special Teacher's Day week, the Fashion For Future portal, which produces content from Italy for fashion students and professionals, invited me to participate in a talk about reflection and action in fashion education and the professional field, titled **#sou_de_humanas**.

The conversation was mediated by **Luz Garcia** from FFF, and my partner was **Mônica Faloppa** from Senai SP. It was a light, relaxed, yet important conversation about fashion education and the expectations and realities of professionals currently in training.
