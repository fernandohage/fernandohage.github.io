*Possible Style Podcast - discussion about inspiration, copying, and plagiarism in fashion*

Concluding my appearances this season on the lovely Marina Santa Helena's podcast, Possible Style, I contributed with some audio comments to a great discussion about copying in fashion, how this system works, and how we can better understand inspiration and plagiarism within the world of products. Trend researcher Rebeca Moraes also participated in this podcast.

## About the Episode

In this episode, we explore fundamental questions about:
