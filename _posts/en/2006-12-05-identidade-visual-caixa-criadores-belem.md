## About the Project

Creation of the Visual Identity for the Caixa de Criadores event in collaboration with designer Junior Oliveira. Based on a brand developed during college, the flyer (which could be assembled into a box shape) and the poster were created for this first edition of the event.

The project represents an important milestone in Fernando Hage's career, demonstrating the practical application of knowledge acquired in his academic training in design and fashion. The visual identity created reflects the innovative and creative nature of the event, using visual elements that effectively communicate the concept of a "box" as a container of creativity.
