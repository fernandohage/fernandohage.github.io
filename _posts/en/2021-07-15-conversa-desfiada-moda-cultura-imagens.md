## Conversa Desfiada: Fashion, Culture, and Images

The **Conversa Desfiada** profile has been hosting weekly live streams about fashion since 2020, and I had the pleasure of participating in July 2021 in a fun chat about my career, my book, my doctoral research, among other things. I was in a phase of being super focused on my studies, so I got really excited and rambled about ideas that have been on my mind. :)

## About Conversa Desfiada

**Conversa Desfiada** is a project that promotes relevant discussions about fashion, culture, and society through weekly live streams. The profile is dedicated to bringing different perspectives on the fashion world, connecting professionals, researchers, and industry enthusiasts.

## Topics Discussed in the Conversation

During the live stream, we talked about various aspects of my professional and academic journey:

- **Professional career** in fashion and teaching
- **Book ["Entre Palavras, Desenhos e Modas"](/en/meu-livro-entre-palavras-desenhos-e-modas)** - creative process and content
- **Doctoral research** - development and main findings
- **Reflections on fashion** and contemporary culture
- **Current projects** and future prospects

## Academic and Professional Connections

This participation is part of my academic dissemination and knowledge-sharing activities on [fashion and culture](/en/territorio-da-moda). The conversation flowed naturally, allowing for the exploration of both technical aspects and broader reflections on the field of fashion.

## Format and Experience

The dynamic of the Conversa Desfiada live streams is very welcoming and allows for a genuine dialogue about the proposed topics. It was an enriching experience to share ideas and exchange perspectives on the paths of contemporary fashion.
