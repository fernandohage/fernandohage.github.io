## Editorial Inspired by the Poetry of Max Martins

The "Blood Forest" editorial was developed for Latitude Hangar Magazine, representing a unique fusion of fashion, poetry, and the culture of Pará. Published in issue #5 in January 2009, the project was inspired by the eponymous poem by Max Martins, one of the great names in Amazonian literature.

### Editorial Concept

The styling was developed for Latitude Hangar Magazine, creating an editorial inspired by the poem "Blood Forest" by Max Martins. The project represented an important collaboration between different artistic fields, uniting fashion, photography, and literature in a production that celebrates the culture of Pará.

The full publication is available at the [magazine link](http://issuu.com/hangarpa/docs/revista-latitude-5), where you can access the full editorial along with other articles from issue #5.

### The Inspiring Poem

#### Blood Forest – The Scent

It still lingers among the washed shrubs.  
From one branch to another the yellow secret is recomposed: PRAY  
to throw stones  
words to the sky  
to protect me.  
And to infuse silence into this wooden hand writing the path.  
I walk for you.  
I walk in the dark tome of a nervous bibliography.  
Your face is what best knows the unsaid  
(from where this river and the obedient night follow)  
They placed a tragic star in the wine of the kiss,  
in the breath with the kiss, in your mouth of the canticle  
of canticles  
of these years.  
Time has carved the miracle of time and rhythm. The tongue  
was the origin of the world. To the Queen-mother of water and waves,  
of the poem of the scent.  
And to the dissolution of love in the threshing of grains.  
From the zenith of the mouth to the sweaty paper of the earth  
the rose's nipples grow. The bloody petals gasp.  
In the autumn harvest of the rooster the scent faints.  
What I still ignore happily hurts me – before you.

— Max Martins

### Cultural Significance

This editorial represented an important appreciation of Pará's literature, translating the poetic richness of Max Martins into the world of fashion. The collaboration between local professionals and the use of clothing from the Costamazônia Association further strengthened the project's Amazonian cultural identity.

The work was published in Latitude Hangar Magazine, a publication that stood out for connecting art, culture, and fashion in the Pará scene, contributing to the dissemination of regional cultural production.

### Project Impact

The fusion of fashion and literature was a milestone in the cultural scene of Pará, demonstrating how different artistic expressions can complement each other to create original and culturally relevant content. The editorial served as an example of how fashion can be a vehicle for promoting regional literature.
