The Research Group on Fashion History and Culture (IAD) at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, coordinated by Maria Claudia Bonadio, has the collaborative Instagram account [@historiadamoda.ufjf](https://www.instagram.com/historiadamoda.ufjf/), which is fed with content created by the research group, as well as being open to contributions from students and researchers in the field of fashion history.

As a participant in this research group, I had the honor of organizing a special feature for Instagram titled "Pará and Fashion," with texts from myself and fellow Paraense researcher friends Graziela Ribeiro, Bruno Furtado, and Susanne Dias.

We created 12 posts that cover the history and culture of fashion, ways of dressing, and elements of Pará's culture, which were posted daily between July 27th and August 8th. Additionally, to launch the special feature, I participated in a live session with Professor Maria Claudia Bonadio discussing these topics. Below is the link to the interview video and the list with links to the special week's posts.
