Another episode of the Estilo Possível podcast by Marina Santa Helena ([@santahelena](https://www.instagram.com/santahelena/)) and in this episode we talked about a controversial, but very interesting topic: kitsch and tackiness in Brazilian culture. The chat was great and went in several directions, from the concepts of the term kitsch since the industrial revolution, to the elements that make up a kitsch aesthetic and how it appears on the catwalks, in decoration, and in costume design. It's worth a listen!
