## First Edition in Belém

I participated in the programming of the first edition of the **Fashion Revolution** event in Belém, an important initiative that questions the practices of the fashion industry and promotes greater transparency and sustainability in the sector.

## Activities Performed

### Chat with Grazi Ribeiro

I participated in a chat alongside **Grazi Ribeiro**, discussing topics related to sustainable fashion and the necessary transformations in the fashion industry.

### Creative Workshop

I led a creative workshop focused on sustainable and creative practices in fashion, exploring innovative alternatives for clothing production.

### Coordination of the Patchwork Flag

I coordinated the creation of a flag made from patchwork, created by students from the Unama Fashion course. This symbolic piece was used during the event to represent the values of the Fashion Revolution movement.

## About Fashion Revolution

Fashion Revolution is a global movement that asks "who made my clothes?" and seeks to promote a fairer, more sustainable, and transparent fashion. The event in Belém marked the beginning of this important discussion in the Amazon region.
