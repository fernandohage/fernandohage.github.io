Thinking about how to create new content for the site (which already has a new color), and linked to the launch of my first book, I decided to create 3 special pages here.

## Page About the Book "Três Séculos de Modas"

The first page is about the book [Três Séculos de Modas](../pages/pt/tres-seculos-de-modas.html), by João Affonso do Nascimento, considered the first Brazilian book on fashion history (which I studied in my Master's degree). On it, I present a summary of the work, links to articles I wrote about it, and a complete gallery with all 56 illustrations.

## João Affonso Library

The second special page I created is the [João Affonso Library](../pages/pt/biblioteca-joao-affonso.html), a project that presents the works that make up the bibliography of the book Três Séculos de Modas and are available digitally. 48 titles and more than 8,000 magazine issues have already been mapped for the page, divided by themes such as: fashion and art history, theatrical texts, illustrated magazines, caricature and illustrated books, French history, and Brazilian works.

## My First Book

Finally, a synopsis of my first book, which will soon be for sale, is now available: [Entre palavras, desenhos e modas: um percurso com João Affonso](../pages/pt/meu-livro-entre-palavras-desenhos-e-modas.html). On the page, you can see the cover, and soon we will have links to stores for purchase. The book is a new version of my Master's thesis, expanded with new texts and even including original texts by João Affonso published in the 1910s.

All pages are in the **SPECIALS** Menu of my site. Visit them!
