A project in partnership between IGAMA (Amazon Gem and Jewelry Institute) and UNAMA. It began in May 2013 with the Fashion Accessories Generation Workshop, taught jointly with Yorrana Maia, aimed at the designers served by the project. They were encouraged to navigate their own references through a creation methodology. The results, after follow-up and production meetings, were presented in a fashion show at Espaço São José Liberto and remained on display at the venue for 15 days between September and October 2013.

## Press Release - Expedition of the Self

Few things are as exciting as the idea of traveling, exploring, discovering. The exhibition and fashion show *Expedition of the Self*, the result of a workshop led by designers Yorrana Maia and Fernando Hage for about 20 professionals from the Gem and Jewelry Project, proposed an exploratory and sensitive dive into the private universe of these creators, in search of objects, words, images, and sensations that called for the enjoyment of beauty and the experiences lived by each of our travelers.

The result is fashion accessories that form a cartography of intimate stories and cherished objects from their collections, which will circulate among other explorers, sharing the impressions of these creators.

Bangles, necklaces, rings, earrings, bags, bracelets, and buckles in varied tones and raw materials, highlighting the material richness of the Amazon region, translate superlative shapes and mixtures typical of Belém and the most recent fashion trends.

This is a new look at everyday objects transformed into contemporary fashion accessories. This concept emerged from references linked to the explorers of the Age of Discovery and their Cabinets of Curiosities, spaces where the most varied organic materials and artifacts collected by their owners were found.

For the workshop participants, this was an opportunity to embark on an "expedition of the self," where the diverse "personal continents" of each of these creators—encompassing their techniques, materials, and style—are recognized and transformed into products.

*The collection is the result of the Fashion Accessories Product Generation – Project Creation Workshop, held in May 2013, which qualified designers and producers from the Pará Jewelry Hub. The fashion show was held at the Casa do Artesão in Espaço São José Liberto, with makeup and backstage production handled by a team of Fashion students from Unama.*

*This action was a partnership between the State government, through the Secretariat of Industry, Commerce, and Mining (Seicom), the Amazon Gem and Jewelry Institute (Igama), and the Fashion program at the University of Amazônia (Unama).*
