## Coordination and Production

I coordinated the event's production with students from the **Fashion Production** course of the **Bachelor's Degree in Fashion at UNAMA**. The project was planned throughout the semester with the goal of holding, in a single day, the two most important events of the Fashion program.

## Event Structure

**Unama Fashion Day** brought together two complementary activities that highlight different aspects of fashion education:

### Coffee with Fashion - Roundtable "The Image of Fashion"

A roundtable with the theme **"The Image of Fashion"**, featuring renowned professionals:

- **Diogo Carneiro** - Fashion Producer
- **Layse Sinatra** - Digital Influencer
- **Laura Navarrete** - Fashion Journalist (El Salvador)

### Mostra Moda Fashion Show

Presentation of looks by graduating students who achieved **excellent grades**. The show featured a special opening with the **"Diabolus"** collection, which had been shown in 2016 at the **Concurso dos Novos - Dragão Fashion Brasil** but had not yet been presented in Belém.

## Student Organization

The students were divided into event production teams, working in different specialized areas:

### Production Teams

- **Communication**: Promotion and press relations
- **Coffee Break**: Organization of the gastronomic and networking space
- **Scenography**: Creation and setup of the event's visual environment
- **Backstage Organization**: Coordination of backstage activities and runway logistics
- **Hair and Makeup**: Beauty production for the models

## Pedagogical Objectives

The event had multiple educational objectives:

- **Practical experience** in producing fashion events
- **Professional networking** with industry experts
- **Valuing** excellent academic work
- **Integration** of theory and practice in education
- **Development** of organizational skills

## Academic Importance

Unama Fashion Day represents a milestone in the students' education, providing:

- **Practical application** of theoretical knowledge
- **Direct contact** with market professionals
- **Experience** in event management
- **Recognition** of quality academic production
