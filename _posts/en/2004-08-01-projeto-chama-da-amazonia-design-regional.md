## About the Project

Projects developed during a Design internship at the perfumery company Chamma da Amazônia. The work consisted of creating apparel products for special dates like Mother's Day and Valentine's Day, which were sold or distributed as part of a bundled purchase in stores in the city of Belém.

This project represents one of the first professional experiences in textile product design, integrating fashion concepts with seasonal commercial strategies.

## Project Features

- **Company:** Chamma da Amazônia (Perfumery)
- **Period:** 2004
- **Area:** Textile Product Design
- **Modality:** Internship

## Products Developed
