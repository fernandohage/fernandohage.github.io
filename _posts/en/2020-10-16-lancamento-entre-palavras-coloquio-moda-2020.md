## "Entre Palavras" Launch at the Opening of the 2020 Fashion Colloquium

I was extremely happy to receive the news that I would be able to prominently launch my book "Entre palavras, desenhos e modas" as part of the official launch schedule of the Fashion Colloquium's Working Groups Meeting - Virtual Edition, after submitting my application to the event's official call for book launches.

At the event's opening, I had 15 minutes to present this project that has only brought me joy, and on top of that, I introduced the official opening lecture, given by historian Denise Santanna, who was my professor and of whom I am a fan. It was a mix of emotions to be at this event, so important to me and for the creation of this book, and to launch it online so that anyone could watch it live.

To watch the event's opening, see the video below, which was made available after the live stream on the Fashion Colloquium's channel:

## Media Coverage

This launch moment was further complemented by coverage in the Pará state media about the event and the book, coverage that I secured with the support of the Prioriza Comunicação press office. See the articles below:
