## Episode Synopsis

We are currently living through an epidemic, but this is far from the first instance, and the planet has already experienced several moments where virus transmission significantly impacted society. The way people dressed was, most of the time, directly related to these events. This was due to the type of manufacturing, hygiene practices, and the number of clothing items.

To tell this curious story, Marina Santa Helena spoke with fashion professor and researcher Fernando Hage ([@fernandohage](https://instagram.com/fernandohage)).

## Topics Covered

During the interview, we discussed:

- **The Bubonic Plague**: How medieval epidemics influenced clothing and hygiene habits
- **The Spanish Flu (1918-1919)**: The impact of the pandemic on early 20th-century fashion
- **Behavioral Changes**: How health crises transformed the way people dressed
- **Social Aspects**: The relationship between public health and clothing throughout history
- **Contemporary Parallels**: Connections between historical pandemics and COVID-19

## Historical Context

The episode explores how major historical pandemics shaped not only society but also patterns of dress and behavior. We analyze how hygiene and protection needs were reflected in fashion choices, from the Middle Ages to the early 20th century.
