The book **"Estudos de Indumentária e Moda no Brasil: Tributo a Sophia Jobim"**, organized by Maria Cristina Volpi and Madson de Oliveira, was published in September 2019 and is the result of a compilation of articles written by the participants of the seminar of the same name held at the National Historical Museum in 2016 ([post here](../2016-09-27-seminario-internacional-de-estudos-de-indumentaria-e-moda-no-brasil-tributo-a-sophia-jobim.html)).

## About the Publication

The publication addresses the legacy of **Sophia Jobim** (1904-1968) as well as the contributions of Brazilian researchers in dress and fashion. This work represents an important milestone in fashion studies in Brazil, bringing together contemporary academic perspectives on the history of national dress.

## My Participation

I had the honor of participating in this seminar, and in this publication, with the text **"Três Séculos de Modas: A Construção de uma História da Moda"**. This contribution reflects my research on the pioneering work of João Affonso do Nascimento and its importance for fashion studies in Brazil.

The publication, in addition to a printed version, is available in the [MHN Digital Library](https://mhn.museus.gov.br/index.php/mhn-lanca-novas-publicacoes-durante-a-13a-primavera-dos-museus/).
