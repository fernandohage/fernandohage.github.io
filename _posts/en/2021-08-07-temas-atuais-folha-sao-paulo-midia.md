## Current Topics in Folha de São Paulo

Between July and August 2021, I collaborated on 2 articles published in Folha de São Paulo that dealt with very current topics and their relationship with fashion: the protest t-shirts worn at vaccination centers and the clothing style in skate culture, one of the most prominent sports of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The articles, the first by Wesley Faraó Klimpel, and the second by Carolina Moraes and Daniel E. Castro, turned out so well that they were republished in other channels.

Access the articles below:From Zé Gotinha to alligators, political messages are printed on t-shirts at covid vaccination sites (13.07.2021) Rebellious look began to be shaped 50 years ago and today shines in skateboarding in Tokyo (07.08.2021)
