Five journalism students from PUC-Campinas (Carla Cristine, Gabrielle Castro, Isabeli Lemos, Jaqueline Guerra, and Rafaela Barbosa) started a final course project to talk about authorial fashion and new creators: the Mood Autoral project. Their goal is to democratize access to information about fashion, especially about authorial brands, Slow Fashion, and Fast Fashion. The project includes a profile on Instagram, Twitter, and a podcast on Spotify called Mood Talk.

And it was in a podcast conversation about "Fashion, Politics, and Representativeness" that I was able to contribute to the project, by answering questions such as:

- How important is it for brands to incorporate protests, social and racial struggles into their pieces?
- Can the fashion show by Zuzu Angel in 1971 be considered the first political statement in Brazilian fashion?
- What precautions should a brand take when choosing the theme of its statement?
