## Participation in the Seminar

I was invited to participate in the seminar held at the **National Historical Museum** on September 27, 2016, a highly important event for costume and fashion studies in Brazil.

## "Pioneers" Section

I presented my work in the **"Pioneers"** section, alongside other great researchers in the field. My contribution focused on the work of **João Affonso do Nascimento** and his pioneering research on constructing a narrative for the history of Brazilian fashion.

## "Três Séculos de Modas" (1923)

The central theme of the presentation was the book **"Três Séculos de Modas"** (1923), by João Affonso do Nascimento, which is the first publication of its kind in Brazil. This historical work is fundamental to understanding the development of fashion studies in the country.

### Importance of the Work

- **First publication** on the history of fashion in Brazil
- **Pioneering** in the construction of historical narratives about costume
- **Influence** on later fashion and costume studies
- **Historical documentation** of Brazilian clothing
