The Amazon Fashion series, a project I participated in and have already mentioned on the blog in a [previous post](2020-05-20-exibicao-da-serie-amazon-fashion.md), in addition to being broadcast on FashionTV Brasil, is now also part of the Amazon Prime app's catalog. This means everyone can now watch the series via streaming.

This is a documentary series that presents initiatives strengthening the fashion production chain segment in the Amazon, highlighting its differences from other regions in Brazil. Each episode is dedicated to a type of product, how it fits into the fashion world, from the origin of the material to the creativity of regional designers and artisans who have combined local elements with creative and current looks (description from the app).
