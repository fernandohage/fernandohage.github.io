# "Moda a Par" Talks on YouTube

{% include youtube.html id="QXLLUr0jIII" %}

At the invitation of my friend and researcher Ma√≠ra Zimmermann ([@mairazimmermann](https://www.instagram.com/mairazimmermann/)), I participated in the debut of '"Moda a Par" Talks', a partnership between the Moda a Par project (@modaapar) and Instituto Cidade, from Santa Catarina, which has a knowledge channel on YouTube.

The conversation was about how to look at trends to capture creative solutions for the future, where we talked about consumption, how to capture signs of fashion trends, as well as the website [Covidinnovations.com](http://www.covidinnovations.com/), which presents creative solutions for the global pandemic we are currently experiencing.
