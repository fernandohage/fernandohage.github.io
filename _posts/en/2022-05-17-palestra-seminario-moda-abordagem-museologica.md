I had the honor of being invited to speak about my doctoral thesis during the "IV Fashion Seminar: A Museological Approach," which was broadcast on the YouTube channel of the School of Museology - UNIRIO, with support from the Casa de Rui Barbosa Foundation, IBRAM, and the Conservation and Restoration Course at EBA-UFRJ.

## About the Seminar

With the theme "Museological Articulations in Times of Pandemic," I was able to present my research on "Images in the History of Clothing," where I presented:

- The research process developed
- The categories created during the study
- The analysis of two symptoms present in *Três Séculos de Moda*
- The evidence of images as important research sources in the field of fashion
- How these sources can support museological work

## My Presentation

My presentation starts at the 5h 28min mark of the video published on YouTube, which is embedded below:

## Organizers and Supporters

The seminar was organized by the **School of Museology - UNIRIO**, with support from:

- **Casa de Rui Barbosa Foundation**
- **IBRAM** (Brazilian Institute of Museums)
- **Conservation and Restoration Course at EBA-UFRJ**

## About the Research

The research presented is part of my doctoral thesis, which investigates the use of images as historical sources in the study of clothing and fashion. The work demonstrates how visual representations can provide valuable information about:

- Clothing practices over time
- Social and cultural contexts of clothing
- Transformations in the history of fashion
- Methodologies of iconographic analysis applied to the study of dress

The investigation focuses specifically on the book *Três Séculos de Moda*, analyzing how the images in this work can serve as documentary sources for museological work and for research in fashion history.
