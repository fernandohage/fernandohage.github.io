## Amazon Fashion Series Broadcast

Filmed in 2018, the Amazon Fashion series started airing on the FashionTV Brasil channel this year, 2020. As I mentioned in a [previous post]({% post_url pt/2018-05-03-documentario-amazon-fashion-fashion-tv %}), I participated in the series by giving testimonials that were used in chapters like *Indigenous Fashion* (episode 3), *Fish Leather* (episode 6), and *Pará Fashion* (episode 4).

The series, produced by HL Filmes, was written by Hermes Leal and directed by Nival Correa.

## Series Summary

The beauty of the Amazon is unique, especially in its use of natural resources, which brings to fashion colorful prints, indigenous influences, leather from aquatic animals for bags and shoes, seeds, and golden grass, across an infinite range of products.

The goal of this series is to showcase this fashion, which is currently expanding, gaining market share, and capturing the desire of women and men of all ages. Each episode is dedicated to a type of product, exploring how it fits into the fashion world—from the material's origin to the creativity of regional designers and artisans who combine local elements with creative, contemporary looks.

Furthermore, the unique fashion from Brazil's Northern region showcases the beauty of local products in shows and events, where we can see the final results from this important production hub being worn by consumers.
