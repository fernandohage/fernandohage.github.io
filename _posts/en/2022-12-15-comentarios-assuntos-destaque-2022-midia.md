Throughout 2022, I was able to contribute to several articles on topics that were highlighted in the media during the year, such as: **BBB 22**, the **Lollapalooza Festival**, **Kim Kardashian** wearing **Marilyn Monroe's** dress, and the discussion about fashion in the metaverse.

## About the Contributions

Throughout 2022, I had the opportunity to share analyses and perspectives on various cultural and fashion phenomena that marked the year. From the trends observed in BBB 22, through the importance of fashion in music festivals, to more complex discussions about cultural heritage preservation and the new frontiers of digital fashion in the metaverse.

Each of these articles represents an academic and specialized look at how fashion manifests and influences different aspects of contemporary culture.
