Between June and July, I collaborated on three different occasions that had something in common: the male universe and the pandemic period we experienced in 2020. See each of the events below:

## Masterclass with Ricardo Almeida

On June 10th, I had the honor of moderating a virtual Masterclass with designer Ricardo Almeida for FAAP students, a two-hour chat with over 100 people, where we discussed how to build a solid 30-year-old brand, the men's fashion market, and the new contemporary challenges.

I wrote a review of the meeting for the FAAP Moda - Estad√£o Blog:

## Cars: Bad with Them, Unlikely without Them?

On June 18th, an article by journalist Eduardo Viveiros about car culture and its new meanings during the pandemic was published on the ELLE magazine website, and I was able to contribute with some quotes.

## What Permanent Style Changes Might the Pandemic Bring?

On July 13th, an interview with me was published on the Gillette brand's website #preparadopravaler about the style changes occurring in the male universe with the pandemic and social isolation, working from home, etc., and how this will affect men's style moving forward.
