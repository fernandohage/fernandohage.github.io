## "The Protection of Identity" Documentary: Intellectual Property of Paintings in Authorial Fashion

I participated as one of the interviewees for the research for the documentary that was part of the dissertation defense "**Nuances of Intellectual Property of Paintings in Authorial Fashion**", by **Clarisse Rodrigues Andrade**, from the Master's in Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer for Innovation - PROFNIT at IFPA Bragança/PA, where I also had the pleasure of participating on the evaluation committee.

## About the Documentary

The documentary discusses the creation of paintings on fabrics and the issue of intellectual property among creators in the creative economy scene of Belém do Pará. The artists **EME**, **Bárbara**, and designer **Lucilene** from the **Jalunalê** brand are interviewed, in addition to the technical and pertinent information from the intellectual property professor at UFPA, **Maria Brasil**.

The documentary simultaneously combines poetry and important information for the creative sector, and it was a pleasure to participate by commenting on the concept of authorial fashion and the creative economy in Belém.

## Topics Covered

- **Intellectual Property** in authorial fashion
- **Creation of paintings on fabrics**

This documentary was produced as part of the master's dissertation defended at **PROFNIT** (Graduate Program in Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer for Innovation) at **IFPA Bragança/PA**, demonstrating the importance of academic research applied to the practical issues of the creative sector in Pará.

Participating both as an interviewee and as a member of the evaluation committee was an enriching experience, allowing me to contribute to the discussion on the challenges and opportunities of intellectual property in the context of authorial fashion in our region.

## Relevance for the Creative Sector

This work represents an important contribution to understanding the legal and creative issues that involve the [creative economy](/pt/territorio-da-moda) in Belém, especially regarding the protection of artistic creations in the textile and fashion sector.
