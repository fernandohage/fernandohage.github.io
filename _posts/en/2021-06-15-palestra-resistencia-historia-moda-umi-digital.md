## Lecture "Resistance in the History of Fashion" - UMI Digital

At the invitation of **Unifor** (University of Fortaleza), I participated in an online lecture on YouTube for **Unifor Moda Integral** (Unifor's Integrated Fashion program), **UMI Digital**, which in this edition had the theme "**RE-EXIST**".

## Lecture Theme

The topic, "**Resistance in the History of Fashion**", was a proposition made to me, and I built a lecture with references from national and international fashion history, showing moments when fashion revealed itself as a field of resistant activity and constant transformation.

## Characters and Movements Covered

My lecture mentions important figures from our fashion history such as:

### International Pioneers

- **Coco Chanel** - Revolution in women's fashion
- **Elsa Schiaparelli** - Surrealism and innovation
- **Martin Margiela** - Deconstruction and experimentation
- **Rei Kawakubo** - Japanese avant-garde
- **Vivienne Westwood** - Punk and sustainability

### National Icons

- **Zuzu Angel** - Political resistance through fashion

### Contemporary Movements

- **Slow Fashion** - Conscious and sustainable fashion
- **Fashion Revolution** - Transparency in the supply chain
- **New perspectives** on fashion that resists, like that of the artist from Par√°, **LaboYoung**

## Relevance of the Theme

The discussion about resistance in fashion is fundamental to understanding how clothing can be a vehicle for political, social, and cultural expression. Fashion has always been a field of tension between tradition and innovation, conformity and rebellion, serving as an important barometer of social transformations.

This type of reflection connects directly with contemporary discussions about [creative economy](/pt/territorio-da-moda) and sustainability in the sector, central themes for the future of fashion.

## About UMI Digital

**UMI Digital** is the event of the Integrated Fashion course at Unifor that promotes relevant discussions about the world of fashion. The "RE-EXIST" themed edition brought reflections on how fashion can be an instrument of resistance and social transformation.

## Watch the Lecture

The lecture was broadcast live on YouTube on the official Unifor channel and was made available for later viewing. The content covers in a didactic and accessible way how fashion can be an instrument of change and resistance throughout history.
