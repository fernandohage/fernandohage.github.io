## Ingredients

### For the crust:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup cold butter, cubed
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 egg
- 3-4 tablespoons ice water
- 1 pinch of salt

### For the filling:
- 6-8 medium apples, peeled and sliced
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

### For finishing:
- 1 egg yolk, beaten
- 1 tablespoon coarse sugar

## Instructions

### Preparing the crust:
1. In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, and salt.
2. Add cold butter and mix with fingertips until it forms a coarse meal.
3. Make a well in the center, add egg and ice water.
4. Mix quickly until dough forms. Don't overwork.
5. Divide dough into two parts (one larger for the base, one smaller for the top).
6. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

### Preparing the filling:
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. In a large bowl, mix sliced apples with sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice.
3. Toss well to coat all apple slices evenly.

### Assembling the pie:
1. Roll out the larger dough and line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan.
2. Pour the apple filling over the crust.
3. Dot the filling with small pieces of butter.
4. Roll out the smaller dough and cover the pie, sealing the edges well.
5. Make a few cuts on the surface for steam to escape.
6. Brush with beaten egg yolk and sprinkle with coarse sugar.

### Baking:
1. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until crust is golden brown.
2. If edges brown too quickly, cover with aluminum foil.
3. Let cool for at least 2 hours before serving.
